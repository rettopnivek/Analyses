This document summarizes the different scripts, their purpose, and their status:

F0_data_creation.R (Finished)
  - Reads in the original .csv file of data and converts it to a .RData file.
  - Creates/adjusts variables.
  - Adds variables with plotting labels.
  - Identifies subjects who most likely flipped "old/new" responses and unflips them.
  - Calculates the total number of subjects.
  - Provides information on each variable and its levels.
  - Creates a new data frame with hits/false alarm rates for subjects over conditions.
F1_Useful_functions.R (Finished)
  - Defines a set of functions for various calculations of an equal-variance SDT model.
F2_Parameter_recovery.R
  - Carries out a parametery recovery simulation study with a single subject.
F3_Parameter_estimation.R
  - Calculates the d' and criterion estimates for each subject using the algebraic method.
  - Saves the estimates to a .csv file (separately for the 13 and 14 condition variants).
F4_Model_checks.R
  - Plots the residuals for the uncorrected and corrected data compared to the model predictions.
  - Plots the distributions of parameter estimates over conditions.
F5_Binary_SDT_algebraic.R
  - Derives the algebraic solutions for a binary SDT model.
