This document summarizes the different scripts, their purpose, and their status:

F0_data_creation.R (Finished)
  - Reads in the original .csv file of data and converts it to a .RData file.
  - Creates some new variables and rescales others.
  - Calculates the total number of subjects.
  - Adds in the duration of the target flash for eachs subject.
  - Provides information on each variable and its levels.
F1_data_preprocessing.R (Finished)
  - Trims data based on a set of cut-offs (RTs too fast, slow, or unlikely under a mixture model).
  - Creates a pdf summarizing the trimming results.
  - Revises the .RData file to include the raw and trimmed data.
F2_useful_functions.R (In progress)
  - Defines a set of useful functions for subsequent modeling
F3_descriptive_results.R (Finished)
  - Generates a pdf with a set of descriptive results describing the data and empirical effects.
F4_starting_script.R (Finished)
  - Loads in needed packages and defines Stan scripts
F5_nROUSE.R (In progress)
  - Parameter recovery using a Bayesian estimation method for a single subject.
  - Obtain/plot group-level estimates for nROUSE model parameters using MLE.
  - Obtain/plot subject-level estimates for nROUSE model parameters using MLE.
  TO DO -> Source code to obtain new data set
F6_simulations.R (Finished)
  - Simulates data from residual latency variant of wald race.
  - Tests parameter recovery under different conditions.
  - Tests model estimation scripts in Stan.
  - Tests parameter recovery over multiple iterations with MLE.
F7_BE_OS.R (In progress)
  - Fits a bayesian model to data from a single subject.
  - Provides basic examples of how to examine convergence and plot marginal posterior estimates.
  TO DO -> Update convenience data-frame column labels
F8_BE_MS.R (In progress)
  - Fits a hierarchical bayesian model to data across all subjects.
  TO DO -> Update convenience data-frame column labels
  TO DO -> create a function to generate better starting values?
F9_post_examinations.R (In progress)
  - Plots convergence checks for a given hierarchical model
  - Plots retrodictive checks for a given hierarchical model
  TO DO -> Update convenience data-frame column labels
F10_MLE_offset.R (Finished)
  - Obtains MLE estimates for 2 models (using a conjugate-gradient method and numerical methods 
    for the derivates):
    A) Hybrid model (priming effects in threshold/drift-rate) with no offset effects
    B) Hybrid model (priming effects in threshold/drift-rate) with a-priori offset effects
  - Calculates the AICc values and weights for the two models, and for a variant of model A in 
    which the offset is applied post-hoc.
  - Plots the goodness-of-fit for the MLE values using joint CDF curves.
Misc_code.R (In progress)
  - Extra, unfinished code.
