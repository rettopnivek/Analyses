This document summarizes the different scripts, their purpose, and their status:

F0_data_creation.R (Finished)
  - Reads in the original .csv file of data and converts it to a .RData file.
  - Creates some new variables and rescales others.
  - Calculates the total number of subjects.
  - Provides information on each variable and its levels.
F1_data_preprocessing.R (Finished)
  - Trims data based on a set of cut-offs (RTs too fast, slow, or unlikely under a mixture model).
  - Creates a pdf summarizing the trimming results.
  - Revises the .RData file to include the raw and trimmed data.
F2_useful_functions.R (In progress)
  - Defines a set of useful functions for subsequent modeling
F3_descriptive_results.R (Finished)
  - Generates a pdf with a set of descriptive results describing the data and empirical effects.
F4_starting_script.R (In progress)
  - Loads in needed packages and defines Stan scripts
F5_nROUSE.R (Finished)
  - Obtain estimates of the nROUSE model parameters for subjects using MLE
  - Generate predicted target/foil latencies from nROUSE per each subject
  - Create new covariates (raw and standardized inverted latencies)
  - Plot and save the results
F6_BE_OS.R (In progress)
  - Fits a bayesian model to data from a single subject.
  - Provides basic examples of how to examine convergence and plot marginal posterior estimates.
F7_BE_MS.R (Planned)
  - Fits a hierarchical bayesian model to data across all subjects.
TO DO -> create a function to generate better starting values?
F8_post_examinations.R (Planned)
  - Plots convergence checks for a given hierarchical model
  - Plots retrodictive checks for a given hierarchical model
